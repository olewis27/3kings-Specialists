      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p> 3Kings Upper Extremity Specialists Inc. is a therapist owned and operated 
        company specializing in Upper Extremity education and services. It&#8217;s 
        president, Jennifer T. Dodson, OTR/L,CHT, is a fellowship trained Occupational 
        Therapist and Certified Hand Therapist that has been practicing outpatient 
        rehabilitation in Jacksonville since 1998. Jennifer was honored to be 
        chosen as a fellow of the Evelyn J. Mackin Hand Therapy Fellowship at 
        the Philadelphia Hand Center in 2001. It is a unique educational opportunity 
        where 2 therapists are chosen from around the world every 6 months to 
        train with the hand surgeons and CHTs of the Philadelphia Hand Center. 
        Past fellows have been from various areas of the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, 
        and Ireland. Part of the mission of the fellowship is to educate therapists 
        from underserved areas so that they can bring their knowledge back to 
        those areas. After the fellowship, Jennifer was determined to fulfill 
        the mission of the fellowship by bringing her knowledge and services back 
        to the Jacksonville area. She is also now a member of the Evelyn J. Mackin 
        Hand Club.</p>
